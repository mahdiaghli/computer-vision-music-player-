Hi everyone! 🖐

Have you ever found yourself deep in work or study and wanted to listen to music at the same time—only to have to fumble over to your phone or switch windows on your laptop?

I had the exact same problem, so I built a gesture-controlled music player in Python that responds to your head and hand movements!

🔹 Features:

Volume Control: Raise or lower the volume with your right hand.

Track Navigation:

Next track: Turn your head to the right.

Previous track: Turn your head to the left.

Playback Speed: Speed up or slow down the music with your left hand.

Play/Pause: Nod your head up to pause, down to play.
